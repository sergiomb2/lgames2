- multimatch games
- vs cpu mode

known bugs:
- view gets into state OPENINGCARD without id in game.openCardIds
- counting errors does not work properly (e.g. 1 zebra known, 2 zebra opened
  for first time but combined with wrong card: does not count as error, setting
  known directly does not work as then every pair counts as error)
