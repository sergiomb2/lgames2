- multimatch games
- vs cpu mode

known bugs:
- view gets into state OPENINGCARD without id in game.openCardIds
- errors not counted properly: e.g. zebra1 known, zebra2 opened for first time and combined
  with another unknown card = no error, although it is an error because zebra1 was known
  solution: for FIRST card closed counterparts must be searched and checked for known if
  one more counterpart was known it is an error
