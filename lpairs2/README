LPairs2
-------

LPairs2 is a classic memory game using animal pictures as standard theme.
Note, that set sizes differ according to whether you run in fullscreen or 
window mode. This is because window mode is 4:3 (assuming someone running 
window mode wants to see something else as well and 16:9 is just to broad 
then). That means if you switch from window to fullscreen while playing 
(menu can be accessed any time by ESC) your current game gets restarted.

You can also try to match triplets and quadruplets (fun, but hard...) and
play against a CPU opponent (or another human player). 

Themes
------

You can create your own themes by adding a new directory in themes named 
whatever you like. You can replace any of the files 
  c_back.png	closed card
  c_focus.png	closed card used if mouse hovering
  c_front.png	opened card (gets motifs added)
  menu.png		overlay for menu (put on top of running game so should be 
		  		somewhat transparent)
  s_			sounds
and put any files into the subfolders
  backgrounds	contains background images
  motifs		contains motifs for building cards (can be of any size,
  				will be scaled up/down as needed)  
  
Note that c_back/front/focus.png MUST all be square and same sized.
Motifs are mandatory. Whatever else is missing is taken from Standard theme.
Motif file names should not contain spaces. Use underscores instead which
will be replaced in game. The file name (without extension) can be displayed
(if enabled in menu) for learning purposes.
  		
If you submit own sets please make sure you use properly licensed images and
state those licenses in a CREDIT file (look at Standard's CREDITS for an 
example).

Enjoy,
