Well not much to say here: It's a classic memory game using animal pictures
as standard theme. Note, that set sizes differ according to whether you run
in fullscreen or window mode. This is because window mode is 4:3 (assuming
someone running window mode wants to see something else as well and 16:9 is
just to broad then). That means if you switch from window to fullscreen while
playing (menu can be accessed any time by ESC) your current game gets 
restarted.

Themes
------

You can create your own themes by adding a new directory in themes named 
whatever you like. Files starting with ...
  b_ 		become backgrounds will be stretched to match fullscreen
  p_		pictures used to build memory cards (can be of any size, square
		or non-square, will be scaled down)
  s_		sounds
  f_		fonts (must be named f_normal.otf and f_bold.otf)
  c_back.png	closed card
  c_focus.png	closed card used if mouse hovering
  c_front.png	opened card (gets pictures added)
  menu.png	overlay for menu (put on top of running game so should be 
  		somewhat transparent)
  		
Note that c_back/front/focus.png MUST all be square and same sized.

Whatever is missing is taken from Standard theme except for p_* files. Those
must be present. So, e.g., you can just put p_* files to build a new set that
uses standard sounds, backgrounds, basic card etc.
  		
If you submit own sets please make sure you use properly licensed images and
state those licenses in a CREDIT file (look at Standard's CREDITS for an example).

Enjoy,
