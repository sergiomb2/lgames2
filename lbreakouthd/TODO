freakout and special levelsets (?) 
allow removing selected bricks (?)

eye/ear candy:
stereo sound
tail for explosive ball, fuzzy chaotic ball

reuse existing previews on starting custom game again
smooth menu tooltips at pointer position
solve waiting for key release in a better way

already known bugs:
