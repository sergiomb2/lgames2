freakout set

eye/ear candy:
stereo sound
tail for explosive ball, fuzzy chaotic ball

show some info on bonus levels and show proper name in label

optimizations:
labels for menu
efficient check for active extras and draw only once per sec
reuse existing previews on starting custom game again
smooth menu tooltips at pointer position
label for score

already known bugs:
l10n doesn't work though mo file is installed???
