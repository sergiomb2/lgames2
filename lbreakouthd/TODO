menu hints

freakout and special levelsets 
quick help
editor
allow removing selected bricks (?)

eye/ear candy:
fix ball shadow
stereo sound
fade effect for power ball, tailing  for explosive ball, fuzzy chaotic ball
have info boxes for old themes centered in empty space not attached to frame
themes should get selection dialog as well
shine effect

optimizations:
labels for menu
efficient check for active extras and draw only once per sec
merge background and brick layer to offset layer
reuse existing previews on starting custom game again

already known bugs:
l10n doesn't work though mo file is installed there
on non-american keyboard: z has to be pressed for y because scancode ain't keycode
