freakout and special levelsets (?) 

eye/ear candy:
stereo sound
tail for explosive ball, fuzzy chaotic ball
themes should get selection dialog as well
shine effect

optimizations:
labels for menu
efficient check for active extras and draw only once per sec
reuse existing previews on starting custom game again
smooth menu tooltips at pointer position
solve waiting for key release in a better way
label for score

already known bugs:
l10n doesn't work though mo file is installed???
