fix ball shadow
warp icon

freakout and special levelsets (?) 
editor
allow removing selected bricks (?)

eye/ear candy:
stereo sound
tail for explosive ball, fuzzy chaotic ball
themes should get selection dialog as well
shine effect

optimizations:
labels for menu
efficient check for active extras and draw only once per sec
merge background and brick layer to offset layer
reuse existing previews on starting custom game again
smooth menu tooltips at pointer position
solve waiting for key release in a better way

already known bugs:
l10n doesn't work though mo file is installed there
on non-american keyboard: z has to be pressed for y because scancode ain't keycode
