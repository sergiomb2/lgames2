LBreakoutHD
-----------

First and foremost to make things clear: LBreakoutHD is an HD remake 
of LBreakout2 (all levelsets and themes will work). The game itself is
completely unchanged. A new SDL2/C++11 view has been added to support 
16:9 wide screens of any resolution. Why not adding this to the existing
LBreakout2 package if the game basically remains the same? Because 
second: I wanted to clean up the code (the not really well working 
network stuff bothered me) and not mix SDL2 with SDL for dependencies.

So LBreakoutHD is a clean cut with the old core engine (still in C) and
a brand new fully scalable 16:9 view. Well, it will be, when it's done.
It's in an early stage right now and a lot of things are still missing
but the game is basically already playable.

Themes
------
The most boring part first: IF you use other people's artwork please check that
the license allows you to change and share it (e.g., GPL, PD, CC, OFL, ...)
and give proper credits in a file named CREDITS (or something like that).
If this is not done, a theme will not be accepted. For your own artwork please
choose a proper license (e.g., GPLv3 will match the package's license).

Ok, that's that. Now, to get started quickly, look at the Standard theme and
keep its dimensions for a 1080p theme. It's pretty much self-explanatory.

To get the fine details, read on.

It's still pixel-based (rasterizing SVG sometimes leads to artifacts and limits
to vector graphics only, so ...). Whatever resolution the images have they
get scaled to the screen/window size. Just bear a few things in mind:

theme.ini allows to set various things. All options have default values
matching LBreakout2 so they are not mandatory. But, e.g., for 1080p assets
you MUST at least provide

brickWidth = 90
brickHeight = 45

Otherwise 40x20 will be assumed which will look very funny. For a 4k theme you
would use 180x90 (remember everything gets scaled up or down to fit the
actual screen resolution).

In general, all images can use alpha for transparency. Black is no longer
used as color key (only for old LBreakout2 themes). For missing files 
Standard theme assets are used as fallback except for the frame (see below).

Assets in bricks.png and extras.png MUST match the given brick size 
exactly. All assets must be in one row (extra space to the right
or bottom hand side doesn't matter).

backX.png (or jpg is now ok, too) are wallpapers or full backgrounds.
They get scaled by the brickScreenSize to brickFileSize ratio. So the 
resolution should match bricks.png and extras.png (so that full wallpapers
will be scaled in the correct ratio to always fill the whole screen).
Maximum number is 10. Background numbers must be consecutive (e.g., 
back0.png, back1.png, back3.png will only load the first two).

menuback.png (or jpg) works the same for the menu background.

The main frame comes in three flavors:
1) frame.png contains the full frame (fitting 16:9).
2) fr_left.png, fr_top.png, fr_right.png build a 4:3 frame (see old 
LBreakout2 frames). Boxes for hiscores, score and active extras are
automatically added.
3) No frame files at all will lead to a standard brick frame.

If you want to create a full frame image here are the measures for the info
boxes (bw = brick width, bh = brick height) given as x,y,w,h: 
	Box 1: Setname+Hiscores: 16*bw, bh, 13/3*bw, 12*bh
	Box 2: Name+Score: 16*bw, 14*bh, 13/3*bw, 3*bh
	Box 3: Active extras: 16*bw, 18*bh, 13/3*bw, 5*bh
So, e.g., hiscores box for 1080p (brick size 90x45) has 1440,45,390,540.

paddle.png needs to be FOUR rows (normal, sticky, frozen, unused) of 
three square tiles (left, middle, right). Some old LBreakout2 themes
have two paddles in one row and I started out with an extra paddle so
it is now required to get the proper dimensions automatically.
Paddle gets scaled to 90% of brick height. E.g., for 1080p tile size
should be 40x40 to avoid unnecessary scaling.

ball.png is one row of square balls (normal, energy, explosive, weak,
chaotic). No extra rows allowed as height is used to determine dimensions.
Balls get scaled to 60% of brick height. E.g., for 1080p tile size
should be 27x27 to avoid unnecessary scaling.

shot.png is a row of frames (shotAnim.frames or default 4). You can set
animation speed by shotAnim.delay (default 200 ms). 
Shots get scaled square to 50% of brick height. E.g., for 1080p frame size
should be 22x22 to avoid unnecessary scaling.

weapon.png is a row of frames (weaponAnim.frames or default 4). You can set
animation speed by weaponAnim.delay (default 200 ms). 
Weapon gets scaled square to 90% of brick height. E.g., for 1080p frame size
should be 40x40 to avoid unnecessary scaling.

explosions.png is a row of frames (explAnim.frames or default 9) for an
explosion. You can set explosion speed by explAnim.delay (default 50 ms).
Explosions can have any size but must be square. In future, more rows for
different explosions will be allowed. 

life.png contains two brick sized, vertically arranged icons for displaying the 
player's lives. The first icon shows a possible extra paddle, the second shows
an actual life. It is added at the lower left-hand side of the frame.

You can specify the small and normal text font (default: fsmall.otf and 
fnormal.otf) and their size (default: 14 and 18 pixels in theme resolution).
You can set the colors with fontColorNormal (default white) and 
fontColorHighlight (default yellow) as red,green,blue,alpha values.
Use GIMP to mix colors or translate #...... hex values.

menu.* in theme.ini allows to modify some menu position stuff. All values are in
pixels in theme resolution. Just play around with the values if you're 
interested in changing it.

Enjoy,
Michael
