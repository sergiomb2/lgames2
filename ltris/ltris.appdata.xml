  <summary>Game of skill with falling blocks</summary>
  <description>
      <p>
          LTris as a tetris clone: differently shaped blocks are falling down
          the rectangular playing field and can be moved sideways or rotated by
          90 degree units with the aim of building lines without gaps which
          then disappear (causing any block above the deleted line to fall
          down).  can watch your CPU playing while enjoying a cup of tea!  
      </p>
      <p>
          LTris has three game modes: In Classic you play until the stack of
          blocks reaches the top of the playing field and no new blocks can
          enter. In Figures the playing field is reset to a new figure each
          level and later on tiles and lines suddenly appear. In Multiplayer up
          to three players (either human or CPU) compete with each other
          sending removed lines to all opponents. And in Demo you can watch
          your CPU playing while enjoying a cup of tea!
