Hold function:
- control key for every player
- box underneath next box with captions (next and hold)
- bowl: hold_id (-1 no piece) and hold_used (true if used until next block locks)
- if key pressed switch pieces and reset piece to top
- half size pieces attached to bowls top/bottom for 2-player

- remove 3player options
- highlight next piece with white background

Known Bugs:
SDL does not properly get cursor position if switching from 
fullscreen to Window and back. It's stuck to wrong 640x480 from
window mode not allowing to reach the far end of the shooting range.
No workaround known. Just decide whether to play in fullscreen or
window and stick to it.
