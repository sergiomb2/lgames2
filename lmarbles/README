Building on Win32:
    1) Install the following win32 tools:
        MinGW
        MSYS
        Inno Setup 2
    2) Install the following win32 libaries:
        SDL (you might need to edit sdl-config)
	SDL_mixer
    3) From the build root, create win32dll directory and copy the following
       win32 dlls to it:
        SDL.dll
	SDL_mixer.dll
        msvcrt.dll (freely available from Microsoft)
    4) configure will need to find SDL.dll. You can either register SDL.dll
       or simply copy it to the root build directory.
    5) Setup environment.  To get things to compile, I setup the following
       environment variables:
        SDL_CONFIG  - fully qualified path to sdl-config
        CFLAGS      - tell build process where to find include files
        LDFLAGS     - tell build process where to find libraries
        PATH        - ensure that Inno Setup 2 iscc is in the PATH
    6) Do a full build by issueing the following commands:
       configure --disable-install
        make
    7) Create a win32 installer by issueing the following command:
        make win32_installer

    You'll find lmarbles-<version>-win32.exe in the build directory.  It
    is a standalone installer for marbles.
